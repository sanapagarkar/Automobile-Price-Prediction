The methodology followed was first, using a dataset of automobile prices based on various factors. Cleaning of missing values was done. After which, out of all the factors (columns), I selected the ones that could have a major impact on the price prediction such as the engine size, horsepower, wheel base, peak rpm, and highway mpg, etc.
The dataset was then divided into train and test data in the ratio 3:1 (0.75:0.25). I used Linear Regression as the model to predict an accurate price of a car.
